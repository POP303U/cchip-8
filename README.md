# Chip-8 Emulator

A Chip-8 Emulator written in C and SDL2.

Personal attempt at emudev, don't take this project to seriously.

_CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language developed by Joseph Weisbecker in the 1970s. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for 8-bit microcomputers at the time, and runs on a CHIP-8 virtual machine._
